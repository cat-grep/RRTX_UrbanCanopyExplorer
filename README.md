# Round Rock Urban Canopy Explorer

**Explore the tree canopy of Round Rock, Texas, remotely.**  

This is a **student side project** built using publicly available LiDAR and imagery from the City of Round Rock. It is **not an official publication**.  

Inspired by my summer internship on Monarch Tree Survey, this React/Vite web app maps vegetation points (classification 5) to highlight canopy extent, using publicly available LiDAR data and imagery. It integrates ArcGIS Maps SDK for 3D exploration and Google Street View for ground-level context, allowing users to remotely explore trees without fieldwork.

## Features

- **3D WebScene**  
  Built with ArcGIS Maps SDK 4.33, providing an interactive 3D view of the urban canopy.

- **Street View panel**  
  Powered by Google Maps JavaScript API, enabling street-level exploration.

- **Two-way sync**  
  - Clicking on the 3D scene updates the Street View marker and camera.  
  - Moving in Street View pans the 3D map and updates the marker position.

## Quick start
### Prerequisites
- Node 18+ and npm
- Google Maps JavaScript API key with billing enabled

#### 1) Install deps
```bash
npm install
``` 

#### 2) Add your API key

Create `./.env.local` at the project root:
```config
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
```

After adding/changing .env.local, restart npm run dev.

#### 3) Run
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Data Preprocessing: LiDAR Vegetation Filtering

To build this dataset, I created a custom [PDAL](https://pdal.io/en/2.9.1/) workflow:
1. Download & extract LAZ tiles from the Williamson County 2024 StratMap project.
2. Convert LAZ â†’ LAS for easier manipulation.
3. Clip LAS to the City of Round Rock boundary.
4. Filter by classification code 5 (high vegetation) to isolate canopy points.
This filtered LAS dataset was then ingested into the 3D WebScene, making it possible to remotely visualize tree canopy extent and structure.

## Internship Connection

This project extends my work as a Summer 2025 GIS Intern with the City of Round Rock.  
During the internship, I helped digitize 300+ Monarch trees and linked them to parcel boundaries for enforcement of the cityâ€™s tree protection ordinance.  

I documented the experience in a StoryMap here: 
ðŸ‘‰ [Making the Most of My Summer with the City of Round Rock](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ef608abad1854ababbfd869bf3115107)

The Urban Canopy Explorer is a personal continuation of that work, exploring how LiDAR + street view can make canopy data more accessible to both professionals and the public.
